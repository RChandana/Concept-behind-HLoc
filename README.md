# The concept of HLoc in brief

## HLoc: Hierarchical Localization - A toolbox for visual localisation
It is the process of estimating the position or orientation (pose) of a robot or sensor within a larger environment.

HLoc allows robots and autonomous systems to have a robust and scalable approach to understanding their position and orientation in complex and dynamic environments.
